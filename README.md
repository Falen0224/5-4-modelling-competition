# 5-4-modelling-competition

This is a group project (minimum 2 students) based around the [Shopee Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/overview) which incorporates both NLP and Computer Vision aspects.

You don't need to submit your project to Kaggle to pass. Aworking submission should be a notebook that produces a reasonable output given the input data.
